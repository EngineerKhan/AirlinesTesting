# AirlinesTesting

Being an Aviation enthusiast, I've been exploring different websites, and often found some issues too. So I thought why not to log them. I had been logging them casually for some time, and have now decided to share them here publicly on GitHub, so it would help the respective IT teams.

Airlines being focused are:

- **Cathay Pacific**
- **Qatar Airways**
- **Singapore Air**

If you want to log any issue, please [log it here](https://forms.office.com/r/uM9XMAd6pg).
